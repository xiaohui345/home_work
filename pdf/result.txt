INTRODUCTION

Founded in February 2005, YouTube has quickly grown
to be the world°Øs most popular video site. Users come
to YouTube to discover, watch and share originally-created
videos. YouTube provides a forum for people to engage with
video content across the globe and acts as a distribution plat-
form for content creators. Every day, over a billion video
plays are done across millions of videos by millions of users,

and every minute, users upload more than 24 hours of video
to YouTube.

In this paper, we present our video recommendation sys-
tem, which delivers personalized sets of videos to signed
in users based on their previous activity on the YouTube
site (while recommendations are also available in a limited
form to signed out users, we focus on signed in users for
the remainder of this paper). Recommendations are fea-
tured in two primary locations: The YouTube home page
(http://www.youtube.com) and the °∞Browse°± page at http:
//www.youtube.com/videos. An example of how recom-
mendations are presented on the homepage can be found
in Figure 1.
1.1 Goals

In its present form, our recommendation system is a top-N
recommender rather than a predictor [4]. We review how we
evaluate the success of the recommendation system in sec-
tion 3 of this paper. An additional primary goal for YouTube
recommendations is to maintain user privacy and provide
explicit control over personalized user data that our back-
end systems expose. We review how we address this goal in
section 2.5.
1.2 Challenges

There are many aspects of the YouTube site that make
recommending interesting and personally relevant videos to
users a unique challenge: Videos as they are uploaded by
users often have no or very poor metadata. The video cor-
pus size is roughly on the same order of magnitude as the
number of active users. Furthermore, videos on YouTube
are mostly short form (under 10 minutes in length). User
interactions are thus relatively short and noisy. Compare
this to user interactions with movie rental or purchase sites

2. SYSTEM DESIGN

The overall design of the recommendation system is guided
by the goals and challenges outlined above: We want rec-
ommendations to be reasonably recent and fresh, as well as
diverse and relevant to the user°Øs recent actions. In addi-
tion, it°Øs important that users understand why a video was
recommended to them.

The set of recommended videos videos is generated by
using a user°Øs personal activity (watched, favorited, liked
videos) as seeds and expanding the set of videos by travers-
ing a co-visitation based graph of videos. The set of videos
is then ranked using a variety of signals for relevance and
diversity.

From an engineering perspective, we want individual com-
ponents of the system to be decoupled from each other, al-
lowing them to be understood and debugged in isolation.
Given that our system is part of the larger YouTube ecosys-
tem, recommendations also needs to be resilient to failure
and degrade gracefully in case of partial failures. As a con-
sequence, we strive to minimize complexity in the overall
system.
2.1

Input data

During the generation of personalized video recommenda-
tions we consider a number of data sources. In general, there
are two broad classes of data to consider: 1) content data,
such as the raw video streams and video metadata such as
title, description, etc, and 2) user activity data, which can
further be divided into explicit and implicit categories. Ex-
plicit activities include rating a video, favoriting/liking a
video, or subscribing to an uploader. Implicit activities are
datum generated as a result of users watching and interact-
ing with videos, e.g., user started to watch a video and user
watched a large portion of the video (long watch).

In all cases, the data that we have at our disposal is quite
noisy: Video metadata can be non-existent, incomplete, out-
dated, or simply incorrect; user data only captures a fraction
of a user°Øs activity on the site and only indirectly measures
a user°Øs engagement and happiness, e.g., the fact that a user
watched a video in its entirety is not enough to conclude
that she actually liked it. The length of the video and user

r(vi, vj) =

where ci and cj are the total occurrence counts across
all sessions for videos vi and vj, respectively. f (vi, vj) is
a normalization function that takes the °∞global popularity°±
of both the seed video and the candidate video into ac-
count. One of the simplest normalization functions is to
simply divide by the product of the videos°Ø global popular-
ity: f (vi, vj) = ci °§ cj. Other normalization functions are
possible. See [6] for an overview of possible choices. When
using the simple product of cardinalities for normalization,
ci is the same for all candidate related videos and can be
ignored in our setting, so we are normalizing only by the
candidate°Øs global popularity. This essentially favors less
popular videos over popular ones.

We then pick the set of related videos Ri for a given seed
video vi as the top N candidate videos ranked by their scores
r(vi, vj). Note that in addition to only picking the top N
videos, we also impose a minimum score threshold. Hence,
there are many videos for which we will not be able to com-
pute a reliable set of related videos this way because their
overall view count (and thereby co-visitation counts with
other videos) is too low.

Due to the high branching factor of the related videos
graph we found that expanding over a small distance yielded
a broad and diverse set of recommendations even for users
with a small seed set. Note that each video in the candi-
date set is associated with one or more videos in the seed
set. We keep track of these seed to candidate associations
for ranking purposes and to provide explanations of the rec-
ommendations to the user.
2.4 Ranking

Video quality signals are those signals that we use to judge
the likelihood that the video will be appreciated irrespective

of the user. These signals include view count (the total num-
ber of times a video has been watched), the ratings of the
video, commenting, favoriting and sharing activity around
the video, and upload time.

Presentation of recommendations is an important part of
the overall user experience. Figure 1 shows how recommen-
dations are currently presented on YouTube°Øs home page.
There are a few features worth noting: First, all recom-
mended videos are displayed with a thumbnail and their
(possibly truncated) title, as well as information about video
age and popularity. This is similar to other sections on the
homepage and helps users decide quickly whether they are
interested in a video. Furthermore, we add an explanation
with a link to the seed video which triggered the recom-
mendation. Last, we give users control over where and how
many recommendations they want to see on the homepage.
As mentioned in section 2.4, we compute a ranked list of
recommendations but only display a subset at serving time.
This enables us to provide new and previously unseen rec-
ommendations every time the user comes back to the site,
even if the underlying recommendations have not been re-
computed.
2.6 System Implementation

We choose a batch-oriented pre-computation approach rather

The actual implementation of YouTube°Øs recommendation
system can be divided into three main parts: 1) data collec-
tion, 2) recommendation generation and 3) recommendation
serving.

The raw data signals previously mentioned in section 2.1
are initially deposited into YouTube°Øs logs. These logs are
processed, signals extracted, and then stored on a per user

basis in a Bigtable [2]. We currently handle millions of users
and tens of billions of activity events with a total footprint
of several terabytes of data.

Recommendations are generated through a series of MapRe-

duces computations [3] that walk through the user/video
graph to accumulate and score recommendations as described
in section 2.

3. EVALUATION

4. RESULTS

The recommendations feature has been part of the YouTube

homepage for more than a year and has been very successful
in context of our stated goals. For example, recommenda-
tions account for about 60% of all video clicks from the home
page.

ABSTRACT
We discuss the video recommendation system in use at
YouTube, the world‚Äôs most popular online video commu-
nity. The system recommends personalized sets of videos to
users based on their activity on the site. We discuss some
of the unique challenges that the system faces and how we
address them. In addition, we provide details on the exper-
imentation and evaluation framework used to test and tune
new algorithms. We also present some of the Ô¨Åndings from
these experiments.

INTRODUCTION

Personalized recommendations are a key method for infor-
mation retrieval and content discovery in today‚Äôs information-
rich environment. Combined with pure search (querying)
and browsing (directed or non-directed), they allow users
facing a huge amount of information to navigate that infor-
mation in an eÔ¨Écient and satisfying way. As the largest and
most-popular online video community with vast amounts of
user-generated content, YouTube presents some unique op-
portunities and challenges for content discovery and recom-
mendations.

Founded in February 2005, YouTube has quickly grown
to be the world°Øs most popular video site. Users come
to YouTube to discover, watch and share originally-created
videos. YouTube provides a forum for people to engage with
video content across the globe and acts as a distribution plat-
form for content creators. Every day, over a billion video
plays are done across millions of videos by millions of users,

and every minute, users upload more than 24 hours of video
to YouTube.

In this paper, we present our video recommendation sys-
tem, which delivers personalized sets of videos to signed
in users based on their previous activity on the YouTube
site (while recommendations are also available in a limited
form to signed out users, we focus on signed in users for
the remainder of this paper). Recommendations are fea-
tured in two primary locations: The YouTube home page
(http://www.youtube.com) and the °∞Browse°± page at http:
//www.youtube.com/videos. An example of how recom-
mendations are presented on the homepage can be found
in Figure 1.
1.1 Goals

Users come to YouTube for a wide variety of reasons which
span a spectrum from more to less speciÔ¨Åc: To watch a
single video that they found elsewhere (direct navigation), to
Ô¨Ånd speciÔ¨Åc videos around a topic (search and goal-oriented
browse), or to just be entertained by content that they Ô¨Ånd
interesting. Personalized Video Recommendations are one
way to address this last use case, which we dub unarticulated
want.

As such, the goal of the system is to provide personalized
recommendations that help users Ô¨Ånd high quality videos rel-
evant to their interests. In order to keep users entertained
and engaged, it is imperative that these recommendations
are updated regularly and reÔ¨Çect a user‚Äôs recent activity on
the site. They are also meant to highlight the broad spec-
trum of content that is available on the site.

In its present form, our recommendation system is a top-N
recommender rather than a predictor [4]. We review how we
evaluate the success of the recommendation system in sec-
tion 3 of this paper. An additional primary goal for YouTube
recommendations is to maintain user privacy and provide
explicit control over personalized user data that our back-
end systems expose. We review how we address this goal in
section 2.5.
1.2 Challenges

There are many aspects of the YouTube site that make
recommending interesting and personally relevant videos to
users a unique challenge: Videos as they are uploaded by
users often have no or very poor metadata. The video cor-
pus size is roughly on the same order of magnitude as the
number of active users. Furthermore, videos on YouTube
are mostly short form (under 10 minutes in length). User
interactions are thus relatively short and noisy. Compare
this to user interactions with movie rental or purchase sites
